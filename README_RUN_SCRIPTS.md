# Script Instructions - SOLTEC.WikiDocGen

This folder contains two scripts to **build and run** the documentation generator.

These scripts can be executed from **any location** — they automatically locate the project folder.

## 🚀 Windows

Run this script:
```
run-wiki-gen.bat
```

## 🐧 Linux/macOS

Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x run-wiki-gen.sh
```

Then run:
```bash
./run-wiki-gen.sh
```

> The generator will automatically detect the path of your main project based on the solution (.sln) file.
